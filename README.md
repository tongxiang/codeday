#DOSOMETHING.ORG CODE DAY!
We'll have two tracks: 
1. Building your own portfolio page, which'll cover the basics of web development: Github, the markdown languages HTML and CSS, setting up  a web page, and perhaps some more advanced CSS and JavaScript animations. 
2. A deep dive into programming with JavaScript. This track will be more heavily dedicated to the nuts and bolts of programming and computer science, as opposed to web development.

##1 - BUILD YOUR OWN PORTFOLIO PAGE
####BARRY'S BEAUTEOUS BLOG GENERATOR - JEKYLL-NOW
Barry's written an [excellent tutorial](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) on how to easily set up your own blog or portfolio site. Before you begin the tutorial, however, make sure to [create a Github account.](https://github.com/)

Note that the tutorial itself gives a lot of background context meant for programmers--don't be daunted! When you begin the tutorial after creating a Github account, skip down to bullet point **"1. Fork a Starting Point.**

####PUTTING YOUR BLOG ON A CUSTOM DOMAIN
So you want to buy your own domain name, eh? We recommend the following domain name registrar: [NameCheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/). It provides the most number of services cheaply, is easy to use, and doesn't pay for [sexist Super Bowl ads.](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Go_Daddy's_advertising) 

After you've thrown up your blog on your own Gitub pages account using Barry's generator, buy a domain name on NameCheap and direct it to your blog--[here's a super helpful tutorial on setting it all up.](http://davidensinger.com/2013/03/setting-the-dns-for-github-pages-on-namecheap/)

another idea: landing page that’s just HTML / CSS. Set up a landing page, just about them.

embedding videos? big video? donations?

##2 - LEARNING JAVASCRIPT

For those of you with no experience with programming, we recommend working through [the CodeAcademy JavaScript course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript). Signup for an account, and work your way through the lessons. 

For those of you who have programmed before, or have seen or touched JavaScript before **(even minimally!)**, we recommend working through the following workshop: [Test-First JavaScript](http://testfirst.org/learn_javascript). 

First, download [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2), the text editor we prefer to write code with. Then, navigate to the [Test-First Javascript](http://testfirst.org/learn_javascript) page and follow the installation instructions.

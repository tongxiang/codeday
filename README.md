#DOSOMETHING.ORG CODE DAY!
Hi! Today, we'll have two tracks: 

1. Building your own portfolio page, which'll cover the basics of web development: Github, the markdown languages HTML and CSS, setting up  a web page, and perhaps some more advanced CSS and JavaScript animations. 
2. A deep dive into programming with JavaScript. This track will be more heavily dedicated to the nuts and bolts of programming and computer science, as opposed to web development.

##1 - BUILD YOUR OWN PORTFOLIO PAGE

####BARRY'S BEAUTEOUS BLOG GENERATOR - JEKYLL-NOW
Barry's written an [excellent tutorial](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) on how to easily set up your own blog or portfolio site. Before you begin the tutorial, however, make sure to [create a Github account.](https://github.com/)

Note that the tutorial itself gives a lot of background context meant for programmers--don't be daunted! When you begin the tutorial after creating a Github account, skip down to bullet point **"1. Fork a Starting Point.**

####WRITING A BLOG POST WITH JEKYLL
The Jekyll blogging system allows you to write posts with Markdown, a way to easily write formatted text. To learn how to use Markdown, check out [this Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and [this in-browser Markdown text editor](http://dillinger.io/), which allows you to instantly see how what you've typed translates into Markdown. 

####PUTTING YOUR BLOG ON A CUSTOM DOMAIN
So you want to buy your own domain name, eh? We recommend the following domain name registrar: [NameCheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/). It provides the most number of services cheaply, is easy to use, and doesn't pay for [sexist Super Bowl ads.](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Go_Daddy's_advertising) 

After you've thrown up your blog on your own Gitub pages account using Barry's generator, buy a domain name on NameCheap and direct it to your blog--[here's a super helpful tutorial on setting it all up.](http://davidensinger.com/2013/03/setting-the-dns-for-github-pages-on-namecheap/)

####ADDING COMMENTS AND GOOGLE ANALYTICS
For comments, create a free [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) account and follow the instructions on Barry's tutorial to include your Disqus shortname in your `_config.yml` file. 

To add Google Analytics (track the traffic to your site!), create a [Google Analytics account here](http://www.google.com/analytics/), and additionally add the shortcode to your `_config.yml` file. 

####CSS & HTML
If you've never encountered CSS and HTML before, begin with [this great tutorial](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-your-first-web-page/). Make sure to download [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) first!

Then, you can begin customizing your site. Try adding another photo to your site, or incorporating some [CSS animations!](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)

If you wanna get fancy with it, try incorporating [some big background videos onto your blog.](http://demosthenes.info/blog/777/Create-Fullscreen-HTML5-Page-Background-Video)

####CHROME DEVTOOLS
To get even *more * fancy with it, check out this tutorial to the [Chrome Dev Tools](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/). It'll give you even more power in evauating what's going on on a web page, and allow you to see what happens if you modify an element's style instantaneously. 

##2 - LEARNING JAVASCRIPT

For those of you with no experience with programming, we recommend working through [the CodeAcademy JavaScript course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript). Signup for an account, and work your way through the lessons. 

For those of you who have programmed before, or have seen or touched JavaScript before **(even minimally!)**, we recommend working through the following workshop: [Test-First JavaScript](http://testfirst.org/learn_javascript). 

First, download [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2), the text editor we prefer to write code with. Then, navigate to the [Test-First Javascript](http://testfirst.org/learn_javascript) page and follow the installation instructions.
